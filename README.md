# ring-detection

Written by Jacob Zietek and Aref Malek

This is a repository for exploring various algorithms in object detection and position tracking. This code is largely experimental and uncommented. A large amount of files have been removed for the code release. You will find the polished work in `release_TP_competition_code`.

Object detection work and testing was mostly done in the `yolo` folder. 

Useful scripts for position tracking are in the `position_tracking` folder.
